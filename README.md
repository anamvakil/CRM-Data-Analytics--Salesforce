# CRM-Data-Analytics-Using-Salesforce

This analysis aims to understand whatâ€™s driving revenue changes over time, in different sales stages, and across marketing efforts. While the company made $124M in total revenue, there are fluctuations and areas for improvement. These fluctuations include lost revenue, underperforming accounts and marketing channels. The goal is to find trends and issues in the sales and marketing process to help increase revenue and improve efficiency.

### Observations:

- 2020-Q3 shows the highest total revenue of $43M and this quarter significantly outperforms others. 2020-Q4 has the lowest total revenue at $18.3M and a sharp decline compared to previous quarters.

- Lost revenue peaks in 2020-Q3 at $11M and has the highest won revenue at $32M. The reduction in loss of revenue in 2020-Q4 can indicate fewer opportunities or better acquisition of leads.

### Recommendations:

- The high performance in 2020-Q3 suggests strong deal closure strategies or seasonal effects. We should investigate what drove success and replicate those strategies in weaker quarters. Since this is beyond the scope of this dataset, we will leave this pointer as is.

- A significant amount of potential revenue was lost, especially in 2020-Q3. We need to analyze lost deals to identify trends (e.g., pricing issues, competition, or deal delays) and find a solution for any problems.

### Observations:

- Total revenue in the pipeline is $15M and it is distributed across multiple accounts and sales stages. The majority of the flow of revenue ends in Closed Won Stage which showcases a strong lead conversion rate.

- Allen182 Inc contributes the highest revenue at $4.1M and Bishop597 Inc and Banks379 Inc also show meaningful contributions at $2.7M and $2.6M, respectively. However, smaller accounts like Black598 Inc and Becker755 Inc show less impact on overall revenue.

- Some amount of revenue attrition can be seen from Proposal/Price Quote (Stage 6) to Closed Lost (Stage 9) however, a larger portion is successfully acquired as Closed Won (Stage 8). 

### Recommendations:

- Continue to nurture account Allen182 Inc as it contributes the largest revenue and shows a strong conversion to closed-won. Focus efforts on Bishop597 Inc and Banks379 Inc, as they show potential for high-value conversions.

- Closed Lost (Stage 9) stands at $2.7M and this indicates room for improvement. We will need to investigate reasons such as pricing issues, follow-up or client management issues etc. for all the lost deals by analyzing CRM data.

- Proposal/Price Quote (Stage 6) still stands at $4.1M. This has high revenue potential and we need to make efforts to make sure we progress these to Closed Won.

### Observations:

- The total revenue generated through different sources is $124M. It is distributed across Marketing ($41M), Account Executives ($35M), Business Development Representatives ($27M) and Alliances ($22M)

- There is a clear variance in revenue generated by each source, which could reflect differences in investment, process efficiency, or the nature of opportunities handled by each.

- While performing reasonably well, AE and BDR trails Marketing, hinting at room for growth through improved prospecting or lead nurturing. The lowest contributor i.e. alliances, suggests the need for a reassessment of partnership strategies or focus.

### Recommendations:

- We need to continue investing in marketing campaigns but also analyze ROI at a granular level to ensure resources are spent efficiently.

- We need to provide additional tools and training for AE and BDR teams to boost productivity.
- Allocate additional resources such as training and budget to AE, BDR and Alliances to strengthen these areas.

- Finally, we need to reassess the current partnerships and explore new collaborations to expand the pipeline.
